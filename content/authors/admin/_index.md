I am a second year Masters student at CMU. I am advised by Professor Alexander Hauptmann and Robert Frederking. I have a broad research interset spanning all three modalities, i.e. vision, languague and speech. My current research focus is on improving cross-modal retrieval and languague grounding. Additionally, I am trying to apply graph based neural networks to various NLP tasks.

Previously, I spent three years (2014-17) in the Advanced Research Lab at Samsung Research, Bangalore. I was working on an interesting problem of extracting event reminders from user conversations. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur in 2014.

In my leisure time, I enjoy the following things:

- Travel and [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51338119-vaibhav) 
- Decipher magic tricks
- Play crazyhouse or bughouse (send me your challenge at [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mysteryvaibhav))
